Overview

The Interval Timer Application is a simple Python-based GUI tool designed to help users manage interval training sessions. It allows users to set a total number of intervals and specify the duration for each interval. The application then alternates between intervals, changing the background color to indicate the start of a new interval. The global timer tracks the total elapsed time, while the interval timer counts down the remaining time for the current interval.

Requirements

- Python 3.x
- tkinter library (usually included with Python)

Installation

- Clone the repository or download the Interval Timer.py file.
- Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.

Run the script using the following command:

"python Interval_Timer.py"

Example

- Total Intervals: 4
- Interval Times: 30, 60, 30, 60

This setup will create a session with four intervals, alternating between 30 seconds and 60 seconds. The background color will change between red and green as the intervals progress. I suggest if you're using it as a workout or interval for resting and working to have your resting interval be the first number you put in, followed by the working time interval.

Example

- Total Intervals: 10
- Interval Times: 600, 3600

This setup would have your rest time last for 10 minutes and then a work interval for an hour
